PROJECT DESCRIPTON : 
This is my university project which I made as a semester project in 8th semester for Integrated Design Project I course. Only front-end development work has been done for UI designs on this project.The main task of this project is that the teachers will sign up by entering our website. Then go to the teachers page and add their location along with their information and submit. Then the students who are looking for a teacher to read them, they can sign up and search by typing the location in the search bar and see which teacher is willing to teach the student in this location.
